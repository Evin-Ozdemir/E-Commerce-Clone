<h4>Hello! I am here with a brand new project. With this E-Commerce (Shopping) Site project that I developed, I designed a platform where products can be discovered, their details can be examined and easily purchased. In the project, a high-performance, scalable and 100% responsive structure was created by using modern files and current technologies.</h4>
